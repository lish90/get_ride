        I gave up my finance career in 2010 to pursue a lifelong dream: to travel the world full time. To support myself, I rent out my apartment on Airbnb. It's been a great experience, so great that I recently wrote a book about it! It's called Get Paid For Your Pad and you can find it on Amazon.

      I also started a podcast under the same name that you can find in iTunes.

      I share my adventures with the world through my blog, The Traveling Dutchman. I love exploring the planet, learning different cultures and discovering new places.

      I'm also a big fan of anything that involves the ocean and starts with an "s", such as scuba diving, swimming, surfing, sailing and snorkeling.

      I love meeting people from different parts of the world and I look forward to connecting with you as a host or traveler. I will do my best to make stay as comfortable as possible or being a good guest, depending on my role.</p>
